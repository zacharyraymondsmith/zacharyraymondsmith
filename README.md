I’m a Data Management Analyst / Sport Scientist at the University of Florida, blending sports science with data to support coaches, athletes, and staff.

Right now I’m focused on learning Python and building simple tools to make day-to-day workflows easier—whether that’s cleaning up messy data, automating reports, or exploring new ways to support performance and research.
